# ascend-runtime-manager

Lightweight manager for Ascend runtime setup and diagnostics.

## Why

This repository isolates system-level Ascend dependency management from runtime repos.
`vllm-hust` can call this manager so end users keep a single install entrypoint.

## Commands

- `hust-ascend-manager doctor`
- `hust-ascend-manager doctor --json`
- `hust-ascend-manager env --shell`
- `hust-ascend-manager env --install-hook`
- `hust-ascend-manager setup --manifest manifests/euleros-910b.json --dry-run`
- `hust-ascend-manager setup --manifest manifests/euleros-910b.json --install-python-stack`
- `hust-ascend-manager setup --manifest manifests/euleros-910b.json --apply-system`
- `hust-ascend-manager runtime check --repo /home/shuhao/vllm-hust`
- `hust-ascend-manager runtime repair --repo /home/shuhao/vllm-hust`
- `hust-ascend-manager runtime repair --repo /home/shuhao/vllm-hust --install-plugin`
- `hust-ascend-manager launch Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`
- `hust-ascend-manager container install --host-workspace-root /home/shuhao`
- `hust-ascend-manager container shell --host-workspace-root /home/shuhao`
- `hust-ascend-manager container install --non-interactive --host-workspace-root /home/shuhao`
- `hust-ascend-manager container exec --host-workspace-root /home/shuhao -- python -c 'import torch; import torch_npu; print(torch.npu.device_count())'`
- `hust-ascend-manager container ssh-deploy --host-workspace-root /home/shuhao --ssh-user shuhao --ssh-port 2222`
- `hust-ascend-manager container ssh-enable --host-workspace-root /home/shuhao --ssh-user shuhao --ssh-port 2222`

Default `euleros-910b` manifest includes:

- `conda config --add channels https://repo.huaweicloud.com/ascend/repos/conda/`
- `conda install ascend-cann-toolkit==8.5.0`
- `conda install ascend-cann-910b-ops==8.5.0`
- `conda install ascend-cann-nnal==8.5.0`

When a system step declares `requires_group: HwHiAiUser`, manager will run it via
`sg HwHiAiUser -c ...` automatically when needed.

`env --shell` is the source of truth for Ascend runtime exports. Runtime repos
should consume this output instead of carrying duplicated shell logic.

`env --install-hook` persists that same source of truth into the active conda
environment by writing `etc/conda/activate.d/hust-ascend-manager.sh` and
`etc/conda/deactivate.d/hust-ascend-manager.sh`. After that, `conda activate`
reapplies the manager-generated Ascend environment automatically, so bare
commands like `python -c 'import torch_npu'` or `vllm --help` do not depend on
manual `source set_env.sh` or ad hoc shell wrappers.

Manager-generated runtime exports also normalize device visibility filters.
Empty or whitespace-only `ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES` values are dropped instead
of being forwarded to child processes, and when only
`ASCEND_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is set the manager derives a normalized
`ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES` from it so `env --shell`, `doctor`, and `runtime`
use the same effective device filter.

`runtime` is the source of truth for repairing a broken `vllm-hust` Python
environment from adjacent runtime repos such as `vllm-hust-workstation`.
It checks whether the active Python can import `torch`, `transformers`,
`tokenizers`, `huggingface_hub`, and `vllm.entrypoints.cli.main` under a clean
`PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` environment. `runtime repair` then reconciles the common
runtime deps, force-reinstalls the Hugging Face stack, installs build deps from
`requirements/build.txt` without replacing the active torch wheel twice, and
rebuilds editable `vllm-hust` against the currently selected Python runtime.
After the editable reinstall, it also runs the repo-local provider helper so
the active environment keeps exactly one installed distribution providing the
top-level `vllm` package, instead of silently importing a stale plain `vllm`
wheel beside `vllm-hust`.
When you pass `--install-plugin`, the same command also installs and verifies
the Ascend platform plugin. It prefers a sibling local repo such as
`vllm-ascend-hust` or `vllm-ascend` when present, and falls back to the PyPI
package spec from `--plugin-package` or the default `vllm-ascend-hust`.

What `runtime repair` covers:

- broken or incomplete Python runtime deps in the active env
- mismatched `transformers` / `tokenizers` / `huggingface_hub` installs
- missing build tools from `requirements/build.txt` such as `cmake` and `ninja`
- stale local `vllm/*.so` artifacts that need an editable reinstall against the current torch wheel
- conflicting top-level `vllm` providers such as a leftover plain `vllm` wheel beside editable `vllm-hust`
- optional Ascend platform plugin install and entry-point verification via `--install-plugin`

What still remains machine-specific or manual:

- NVIDIA / Ascend driver packages and kernel modules on the host
- CANN / NNAL / ATB system layout problems that require `doctor` / `setup`
- model weights, Hugging Face reachability, mirror policy, and local cache completeness
- systemd user-session availability and public ingress plumbing such as Cloudflare Tunnel
- any repo-local changes that require a different torch major/minor than the manager default

The manager also normalizes non-standard Ascend installs, for example when the
host only has directories like `/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit.bak.8.1/latest`
instead of the canonical `/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest` symlink.
`doctor` verifies whether `torch_npu` can be imported under the manager-generated
environment, and `launch` always runs with that normalized environment.
When the canonical `runtime/version.info` files are missing, `doctor` also
falls back to non-standard toolkit path names such as `cann-8.5.1/` or
`ascend-toolkit.bak.8.5.1/` so `HUST_ASCEND_RUNTIME_VERSION` stays populated in
reports from partially normalized hosts.
`doctor` also detects a broken host OPP legacy-kernel layout where
`kernel/config/ascend910_93/ops_legacy/*.json` points at
`kernel/ascend910_93/<op>/...` but the installed files only exist under
`kernel/ascend910_93/ops_legacy/<op>/...`. When this happens, even basic
`torch_npu` operators such as `torch.zeros()` can fail before vLLM starts; the
correct fix is to repair or reinstall the host CANN ops package. As a practical
workaround, `env --shell` and `launch` now auto-generate a user-space OPP
overlay under `~/.cache/hust-ascend-manager/opp-overlays/` and point
`ASCEND_OPP_PATH` at that overlay when this broken layout is detected.

`launch` also enables a prefill compatibility mode by default on Ascend: it
injects `--no-enable-prefix-caching` and `--no-enable-chunked-prefill` unless
you already passed explicit prefill flags yourself. This is a pragmatic
workaround for known `npu_fused_infer_attention_score` dimension crashes on some
model/runtime combinations. To opt out, pass `--no-prefill-compat-mode`.

`container` is the source of truth for the official Huawei Ascend container
workflow. `container install` is the one-click path: it pulls the configured
image when needed, mounts Ascend devices and driver paths from the host, mounts
your workspace into `/workspace`, and creates or starts a persistent container.
When `--image` is omitted, the manager defaults to the official `v0.23.0` image
family, probes the host for an A2/910B vs A3 recommendation, and interactively
confirms the official variant (`v0.23.0`, `-a3`, `-openeuler`, or
`-a3-openeuler`). Use `--non-interactive` to skip prompts in automation.
The image supplies CANN Toolkit, kernels/ops, HCCL, Torch-NPU, vLLM, and
vLLM-Ascend. The manager bind-mounts host device/driver interfaces only; it does
not mount or require a host CANN Toolkit or host CANN ops installation.
Use `container shell` to enter that environment later without rebuilding the
mount list, and `container exec -- ...` to run one-off checks or launches.
If you want a single-command deployment for direct SSH access into the container,
run `container ssh-deploy`. It creates or starts the container, installs
`openssh-server` inside it when needed, configures a dedicated SSH port, and
copies your mounted `authorized_keys` into the container user home.
`container ssh-enable` remains available when the container is already running
and you only want to refresh the in-container SSH setup.

The design follows upstream vLLM's plugin philosophy: hardware-specific setup
and runtime adaptation should live outside the upstream core runtime path.

## Install

```bash
cd /home/shuhao/ascend-runtime-manager
python -m pip install -e .
```

Or install from PyPI (recommended for teammates):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade hust-ascend-manager
```

## Publish

Local publish with token:

```bash
cd /home/shuhao/ascend-runtime-manager
PYPI_TOKEN=pypi-xxxxx bash scripts/publish_pypi.sh
```

CI publish:

- set repository secret `PYPI_TOKEN`
- push a tag like `v0.1.0` or run workflow dispatch

## Notes

- `setup --apply-system` executes commands from manifest and may require sudo.
- Use `setup --non-interactive` when calling manager from automation. It will fail fast instead of hanging on an interactive `sg` or `sudo` password prompt.
- `setup --install-python-stack` now auto-probes `https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple` when `PIP_INDEX_URL` is unset, and falls back to the default upstream index when the mirror is unreachable.
- Tune large wheel downloads with `HUST_ASCEND_MANAGER_PIP_RETRIES`, `HUST_ASCEND_MANAGER_PIP_TIMEOUT`, `HUST_ASCEND_MANAGER_PIP_RESUME_RETRIES`, `HUST_ASCEND_MANAGER_PIP_INDEX_URL`, and `HUST_ASCEND_MANAGER_PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`. Set `HUST_ASCEND_MANAGER_DISABLE_PYPI_MIRROR_AUTOSET=1` to disable automatic mirror selection.
- `container` uses `docker` directly when available, otherwise falls back to `sudo -n docker`.
- `container ssh-deploy` is the one-click path for direct SSH-to-container access.
- `container ssh-enable` defaults to host port `2222`, user `shuhao`, and `authorized_keys` source `/workspace/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
- Keep binary payloads out of this repository. Use internal mirrors/artifact stores.
- If your account was newly added to `HwHiAiUser`, re-login is still recommended.
- `setup` is intentionally tolerant of a partially broken initial Ascend install: it can still reconcile the Python stack and planned CANN steps even when `doctor` cannot yet build a complete runtime env.
